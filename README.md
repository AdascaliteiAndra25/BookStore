"# LibraryProject" 
This project implements a bookstore management system using the Java API and a MySQL database. The system allows two types of users: Customer and Admin. Each user type has different permissions for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the books in the store.

Customer: Can view the available books in the store and purchase one book at a time.
Admin: Can view the user table, add and delete users, as well as view the order history table along with the customer ID that handled each order. Additionally, the admin can generate a PDF report with the history of all orders placed in the store.

The system uses a MySQL database connection to store and manipulate information about books and users.
